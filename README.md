<h1>Choose The Right -  Match 3 App </h1>
<p>This repository holds the work done in the internship for Andrew Lake - Owner Operator Formerly of A&A Computers - under R.E.A.L Projects for Weber State University - Spring 2022</p>
<p>The work was done in Java, and milestones were completed before the end of the semester - marking the end of the internship</p>
<p>Internship length: January 2022 - April 2022 (Spring Semester of 2022)</p>

<h2>What Was Asked?</h2>
<p>Andrew Lake came to us with the desire to make his board game into a digital game. A market research was done, which resulted in the decision to modify the board game into a Match 3 app - developed for all platforms</p>

<h2>What Was Done by Me?</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Market Research - to find target audience, platform... </li>
  <li>Menu - Developed a menu for the user to choose what to do</li>
  <li>10x10 Grid - Tile values for the 10x10 grid were randomly generated, and the tiles were randomly place through an algorithm</li>
  <li>Match Checker Algorithm - Algorithm that checks for matching tiles in grid (3 tiles, 4 tiles and 5 tiles matches - horizontally and vertically)</li>
  <li>Match Remover Algorithm - Algortihm that removes the matching tiles in the grid and fills it up with different values</li>
  <li>Exit - Exit the program if desired by user (ending the game)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Extra</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Player Creation - For the user to create its own player and have its resistances and weaknesses values randomly generated (possible to re-roll)</li>
  <li>Instructions - Prints the instructions for the player</li>
</ul>
